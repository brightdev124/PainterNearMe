ðŸš¨ IMMEDIATE 500 ERROR FIX ðŸš¨

STEP 1: Upload debug-500.php to your server
STEP 2: Visit https://painter-near-me.co.uk/debug-500.php

This will show you exactly what's causing the 500 error.

QUICK FIXES TO TRY:

FIX 1: Replace .htaccess with emergency version
- Delete current .htaccess
- Upload .htaccess-emergency as .htaccess

FIX 2: Check file permissions
- All .php files should be 644
- All directories should be 755
- project.env should be 600

FIX 3: Most likely cause - missing directories
Make sure these folders exist on your server:
- core/
- config/
- assets/
- uploads/
- logs/

FIX 4: If debug-500.php shows bootstrap.php error:
The issue is likely a missing file or wrong path.

EMERGENCY BYPASS:
If nothing works, create a simple index.php:
<?php echo "Site is loading..."; ?>

This will at least stop the 500 error while we fix the main issue.
