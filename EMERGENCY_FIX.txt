ðŸš¨ IMMEDIATE EMERGENCY FIX ðŸš¨

UPLOAD THIS FILE IMMEDIATELY: bootstrap.php

The redirect loop is caused by the forceHTTPS() function in bootstrap.php
This has been DISABLED in the updated bootstrap.php file.

STEPS:
1. Upload the updated bootstrap.php file (replaces the old one)
2. Upload the .htaccess-minimal file as .htaccess (replaces the old one)
3. Wait 2-3 minutes
4. Test the site

This will completely stop the redirect loop.

The hosting provider is handling HTTPS redirects automatically,
so our PHP and .htaccess redirects were creating a conflict.

âœ… FIXED: bootstrap.php line 286 - forceHTTPS() disabled
âœ… FIXED: .htaccess-minimal - no HTTPS redirects
