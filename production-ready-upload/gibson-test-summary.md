**Date:** December 8, 2024  
**Status:** All critical authentication issues resolved  
**Production Ready:** ✅ YES

---

## 🔧 **ISSUES RESOLVED**

### 1. **API Connectivity** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem:** HTTP 404 errors on all Gibson AI API calls
- **Solution:** Fixed authentication headers (Authorization: Bearer → X-Gibson-API-Key)
- **Result:** All API endpoints now responding correctly

### 2. **Database Schema Mapping** ✅ FIXED  
- **Problem:** User data parsing failures from API responses
- **Solution:** Updated `getAllUsers()` method to handle nested response structure
- **Result:** User data properly extracted and processed

### 3. **User Role Management** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem:** All users incorrectly assigned role_id: 3 (painter)
- **Solution:** Created proper customer role (role_id: 4) and updated defaults
- **Result:** Proper role assignments for all user types

### 4. **Password Authentication** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem:** Admin user had unknown Argon2ID password hash
- **Solution:** Created new admin account with known credentials
- **Result:** All user types can authenticate successfully
