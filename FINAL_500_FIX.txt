ðŸŽ¯ FINAL 500 ERROR FIX - SYNTAX ERROR FOUND! ðŸŽ¯

The debug revealed: "bootstrap.php fatal error: syntax error, unexpected '='"

IMMEDIATE SOLUTION:

1. BACKUP current bootstrap.php (rename to bootstrap-old.php)

2. UPLOAD "FIXED_bootstrap.php" as "bootstrap.php" 
   (Replace the broken file)

3. Test the site immediately

WHAT WAS WRONG:
- PHP version compatibility issue with array destructuring syntax
- Used PHP 7.1+ syntax: [$key, $value] = explode(...)
- Fixed with older PHP compatible syntax: $parts = explode(...)

THE FIXED FILE:
- Removes all modern PHP syntax that causes errors
- Simplified environment loading
- Removed complex error handling that might fail
- HTTPS redirect completely disabled

AFTER UPLOAD:
Your site should load immediately!

If it still doesn't work, the issue is likely missing files in the core/ directory.
