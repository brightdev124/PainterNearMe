🚨 EMERGENCY FIX FOR REDIRECT LOOP ERROR 🚨

If you're seeing "ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS" error:

1. IMMEDIATELY replace .htaccess with .htaccess-no-https-redirect:
   
   Delete: .htaccess
   Rename: .htaccess-no-https-redirect to .htaccess
   
   This removes the HTTPS redirect that's conflicting with your hosting provider.

2. Wait 2-3 minutes for DNS propagation
3. Test the website - it should load properly

The hosting provider is already handling HTTPS redirects, so our .htaccess redirect was creating a loop.
