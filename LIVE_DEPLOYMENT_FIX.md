# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Fix for painter-near-me.co.uk

## Problem Identified
The live website shows "Service Temporarily Unavailable" due to a **redirect loop** caused by conflicting HTTPS redirects.

## IMMEDIATE FIX (Do this now!)

### Step 1: Replace .htaccess File
Your hosting provider already handles HTTPS redirects, so you need to use the emergency .htaccess file:

1. **Download** the current `.htaccess-emergency` file from your project
2. **Rename** it to `.htaccess` 
3. **Upload** and replace the existing `.htaccess` on your live server

### Step 2: Alternative Quick Fix
If you have cPanel/File Manager access:
1. Go to your live website's `public_html` folder
2. Find the `.htaccess` file
3. Edit it and **remove these lines:**
```apache
# Smart HTTPS redirect (avoids loops with hosting provider HTTPS)
# Only redirect if not already HTTPS and not coming from a proxy
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
RewriteCond %{HTTP:X-Forwarded-Proto} !https
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^painter-near-me\.co\.uk$ [NC]
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://painter-near-me.co.uk/$1 [L,R=301]
```

### Step 3: Wait and Test
1. Wait 2-3 minutes for changes to take effect
2. Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+F5)
3. Test: https://painter-near-me.co.uk
4. The website should now load properly!

## Root Cause
Your hosting provider automatically redirects HTTP to HTTPS, but the .htaccess was also trying to do this, creating an infinite loop.

## Verification Steps
After the fix:
- âœ… Homepage should load: https://painter-near-me.co.uk
- âœ… No "Service Temporarily Unavailable" error
- âœ… All pages accessible
- âœ… SSL certificate working

## If Still Not Working
Try these in order:

### Option A: Use Minimal .htaccess
Replace with this minimal version:
```apache
RewriteEngine On

<Files "project.env">
    Order allow,deny
    Deny from all
</Files>

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . index.php [L]
```

### Option B: Check Hosting Provider Settings
1. Verify domain is pointing to correct hosting account
2. Check if SSL certificate is properly installed
3. Ensure PHP 8.1+ is enabled
4. Verify Apache mod_rewrite is enabled

### Option C: Contact Hosting Support
If website still doesn't load, contact your hosting provider about:
- SSL certificate status
- Apache configuration
- PHP version settings
- Domain DNS settings

## Success Indicators
When fixed, you should see:
- âœ… **Homepage loads with your painting quote form**
- âœ… **HTTPS works properly** 
- âœ… **No redirect errors**
- âœ… **All navigation links work**

## Emergency Contact
If this doesn't work immediately:
1. Check your hosting provider's error logs
2. Verify all files uploaded correctly
3. Ensure project.env file exists with correct settings
